# Notes:
# * GDAL==3.2.0 is currently supported by "release-1911-x64-gdal-3-2-0-mapserver-7-6-1",
#   check https://gisinternals.com/release.php
# * After the very first install, the gdal_merge.py does not work, because of missing
#   osgeo.gdal_array wrapper (_gdal_array.cp37-win_amd64.pyd). 
#   Workaround: Reinstall GDAL
